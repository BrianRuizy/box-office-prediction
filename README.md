Machine learning project using a large historical dataset to predict a movie's 'success'

## About
This learning project aims at exploring the use of an official Cinema dataset by reading, writing, cleaning and then implementing a Machine Learning model to be trained and predict the success of a movie release. Success can be measured by various different parameters; this program aims at finding relationships between those parameters and consider what makes a movie "succesful". Will then compare the accuracy of both *linear Regression* against *Random Forest Regression*. 

## Dependencies
